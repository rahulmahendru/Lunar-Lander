# Lunar-Lander
This program has been written to design a similar game to our old favourite lunar lander.
The rocket is controlled by the arrow keys and the mouse. 
Banging the rocket in any of the window screens will result in failure.
Keep track of the fuel, the rockets only allows 8 seconds after the fuel is exhausted.
The speed limit for landing is a 50.
